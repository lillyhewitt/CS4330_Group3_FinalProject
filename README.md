## Project Title:
LightSense: An Ambient Light Notification System

Group Members:
● Dewan Tasneem - tul38268@temple.edu
● Lilly Elizabeth Hewitt - tuo47895@temple.edu

Sensors:
★ Proximity Sensor (TYPE_PROXIMITY: Position Sensor)
★ Ambient Light Sensor (TYPE_LIGHT: Environment Sensor)

Goal:
➔ To develop an Android App that sends notifications on your phone based
on ambient light levels in the surrounding environment. The user
essentially receives alerts when the light conditions in the specific
location/area meet, exceed, or fall below predefined thresholds.
◆ i.e. You are outside and your phone receives a notification to turn
the brightness down because it is very bright and sunny outside.
Reason being is the fact that the brightness outside causes your
phone's battery to drain faster, so in order to maximize your battery
life, your phone will suggest that you lower the brightness on your
phone.
➔ In addition to this, we want to ensure that the notifications are being
received when the phone is in use through the use of the proximity sensor.
◆ i.e. Whenever your phone is in your pocket or face down, the
proximity sensor will be used to ensure the phone does not receive
any notifications during those circumstances.

Scenario:
➢ Target People
○ Users with older phones with limited battery life.
○ Users with phones that have short battery life regardless of the
device's age.
○ Users who spend more hours than usual on their phone and need to
optimize their battery life.
○ Users who are sensitive to brightness on their phones or have any
health/sight issue relating to their eyes.
➢ With this app, users can optimize/save their battery life by following the
instructions/recommendations they receive in their notifications, while
simultaneously being able to maintain better health for their eyes.

Demo:
❖ For the demo we plan on turning the lights in the room in order to
create a dark environment. The app will then send a notification to the
Android phone to recommend switching the phone to dark/night mode,
showcasing its capability to respond to low ambient light levels.
